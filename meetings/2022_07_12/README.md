## Discussion

- There was a discussion about collaborating on a paper on SROS2, targeting possibly the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) (similar to [this](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00456) published paper). 
- It was proposed to develop a survey to learn how many people have used SROS2 and their challenges.
- The August meeting is canceled for the summer break.
