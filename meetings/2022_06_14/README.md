## Discussion

- We had a guest presentation by Andre Santos, maintainer of the [HAROS (High-Assurance ROS) Framework](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros). Andre shared an overview of the tool, a quality assurance framework based on static analysis of ROS code. There was discussion around usage examples, plugins, ROS 2 support, and future directions for development.
